My name is Josemiguel, I love technology and everything related to it.
I have been working in telecommunications for over 24 years, in posts that range from outside plant to commercial and managerial.
My experience includes working with Telephony Systems, Microwave Links, IP Networks, Internet Delivery, Core Networks (for Cellular Companies), and overall ICT (including software platforms such as ERP, CRM, Billing, etc).
I want to put all my experience into serving a global company that can take advantage of the knowledge I obtained throughout the years and add value to whichever team I join.
Education is the one tool that we can all use to make this a better world, and enabling access of it through technology to remote sites and populations can make a difference in bridging the digital divide.
My main objective is to serve as an instrument to help close the digital divide anywhere I can.
